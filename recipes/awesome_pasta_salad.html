    <h1>Awesome Pasta Salad</h1>
    <img src="../img/awesome_pasta_salad.jpeg" alt="A picture of an awesome pasta salad">
    <p>A pasta salad is a delightful dish that combines cooked pasta with a medley of fresh and flavorful ingredients.
        It typically starts with al dente pasta, such as rotini or bowtie, which serves as the base. The pasta is then
        tossed with an assortment of colorful vegetables like crisp bell peppers, juicy cherry tomatoes, crunchy
        cucumbers, and tangy red onions. To add a burst of flavor, it is common to include ingredients such as olives,
        feta cheese, or Parmesan. The salad is then dressed with a zesty vinaigrette or creamy dressing, which brings
        all the elements together harmoniously. This versatile dish can be enjoyed as a refreshing side at a summer
        barbecue, a light lunch, or a satisfying main course for any pasta lover. Its combination of textures, vibrant
        colors, and mouthwatering flavors make pasta salad a crowd-pleasing favorite for any occasion.
